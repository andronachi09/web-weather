## Reflection

This project represent an example which integrates different technologies for creating a responsive web application for real-time
weather data visualization. For fetching the real-time weather data, the Weather API was utilized. In order to hide the API key for
production, a server was developed. The server is hosted on Google Cloud Platform/App Engine. For map view, Mapbox API was used, which
offer users an interactive map view. UI inspiration: https://dribbble.com/shots/21505269-Weather-Dashbard-App.
